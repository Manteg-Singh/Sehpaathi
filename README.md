## Project Write-up

Problem Definition-
There are millions and billion pieces of data available, but making the right
information accessible when needed is very important. Getting the right
documents to read and further getting a direct answer to oneâ€™s question from
the set of documents is a challenging task. Even with the abundance of
resources it often becomes quite difficult for students to find quality answers
to questions while studying. Students often get caught up juggling between
websites and are still left with their heads scratching.

## Submission-
Our solution is a AI Enabled Answering Bot that helps students find quality
answers and study materials to their questions.
Automated Answering is the process of computing answers by computers
where answering models are learned using web scraping and natural
language processing
It is a method of educational assessment and an application of natural
language processing (NLP).
A question answering system is concerned with building systems that
automatically answer questions posed by humans in a natural language.
A QA system is generally programmed to pull answers from a structured
database or an unstructured collection of natural language document/s.
There are two types of question answering.
One is Closed-domain question-answering system which basically deals
with questions under a specific domain and the other is Open-domain
question answering which is concerned with questions about nearly
anything.
Our solution also incorporates an image processing model that helps
extracting texts from images and can further be used in our QA model. This
allows us to expand the utility of our software in our day-to-day lives.
